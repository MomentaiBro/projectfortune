### NOTE -- THIS APP IS A WORK IN PROGRESS ### 

# Project Fortune

This is a rookie CLI app work-in-progress. The main idea was to create a fortune-telling machine where the fortune teller, Madame Kotake, reads you off a fortune. Unfortunately, Madame Kotake thinks paying her student devs in "free fortunes" is enough to pay rent so we stopped just short of a working log-in screen. 

## Description

Wait for Madame Kotake to ask you for your name. Type in your name and see if you're on her list.

## Getting Started

run the ruby file named runner.rb to begin.

### Dependencies

No dependencies needed. 

### Installing

No download available yet, stay tuned for more! 

### Executing program

  1. open up your command terminal 
  2. load the ProjectFortune directory
  3. once the directory is open, run the runner file by typing in ```ruby runner.rb```
  4. wait for Madame Kotake to ask for your name.
  5. type in your name. If you are on her list, she will let you know. 
  6. enjoy this very basic app.
